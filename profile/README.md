Key Numbers and Financial Insights: Arctic Rare Earth Metals

The Arctic region is a promising frontier for rare earth metals (REEs), critical for technologies like electric vehicles, wind turbines, and smartphones. Below are the essential figures and economic highlights:

	â€¢	Global Market Value:The global rare earth metals market was valued at USD 3.79 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach USD 8.23 billion by 2032, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.7%. This reflects surging demand driven by the green transition and smart technologies.
	â€¢	Arctic Reserves:
	â€¢	Sweden: The Kiruna area hosts over 1 million tonnes of rare earth oxides, the largest known deposit in Europe, discovered by state-owned LKAB.
	â€¢	Russia: Holds considerable reserves, though specific tonnage is less defined; import dependence for certain REEs is 80-90%, highlighting extraction challenges.
	â€¢	Regional Potential: The Arcticâ€™s exact REE reserves are hard to quantify due to exploration difficulties, but its resource wealth is significant, alongside 13% of the worldâ€™s undiscovered oil and 30% of its natural gas.
	â€¢	Demand Growth:The International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasts that REE demand will triple by 2040, fueled by low-carbon technologies like wind, solar, and electric vehicles.
	â€¢	Investment Example:Australiaâ€™s Lynas Rare Earths is investing USD 1.2 billion to expand its Mount Weld mine and processing capabilities, illustrating the scale of capital neededâ€”and potential returnsâ€”in the REE sector. Arctic projects could see similar investments.
	â€¢	Economic and Strategic Impact:Developing Arctic REEs could transform the regionâ€™s economy, reduce reliance on China (which supplies 60% of global REEs), and support sustainable development goals by enabling carbon-reducing technologies. However, careful environmental management is essential to mitigate miningâ€™s ecological footprint.

This data underscores the Arcticâ€™s growing role in the REE market, blending vast resource potential with significant economic promise. For further research, explore sources like the IEA, LKAB announcements, and market analyses from 2024-2032 projections.

### Survey Note: Comprehensive Analysis of the International Arctic Forum 2025

The International Arctic Forum 2025, as part of the Arctic Council's activities, represents a pivotal year under Norway's chairship (2023-2025), focusing on fostering cooperation among Arctic states, indigenous peoples, and other stakeholders. This note provides a detailed examination of the forum's priorities, activities, and significant events, drawing from current information available as of March 27, 2025.

#### Background and Structure
The Arctic Council, established in 1996 by the Ottawa Declaration, is the leading intergovernmental forum for addressing Arctic issues, particularly sustainable development and environmental protection. It comprises eight Arctic states (Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden, and the United States) and six permanent participants representing indigenous peoples, including the Aleut International Association, Arctic Athabaskan Council, Gwich'in Council International, Inuit Circumpolar Council, Russian Association of Indigenous Peoples of the North, and Saami Council. Decisions are made by consensus, with full consultation of permanent participants, ensuring inclusive governance ([Arctic Council Overview](https://arctic-council.org/about/)).

#### Current Chairship: Norway (2023-2025)
Norway assumed the chairship in May 2023, following a challenging period marked by the pause in council activities due to geopolitical tensions, particularly Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The Norwegian chairship, set to conclude in 2025, aims to promote stability and constructive cooperation, focusing on core issues like climate change, sustainable development, and the well-being of Arctic inhabitants. This leadership is crucial for resuming project-level work, with virtual Working Group meetings reinstated in 2024 to advance environmental and developmental initiatives ([Arctic Council Resumption](https://arctic-council.org/news/arctic-council-advances-resumption-of-project-level-work/)).

#### Thematic Priorities
Norway's chairship is structured around four thematic priorities, each with cross-cutting focuses on Arctic youth and indigenous peoples:
