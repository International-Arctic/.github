Key Numbers and Financial Insights: Arctic Rare Earth Metals

The Arctic region is a promising frontier for rare earth metals (REEs), critical for technologies like electric vehicles, wind turbines, and smartphones. Below are the essential figures and economic highlights:

	•	Global Market Value:The global rare earth metals market was valued at USD 3.79 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach USD 8.23 billion by 2032, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.7%. This reflects surging demand driven by the green transition and smart technologies.
	•	Arctic Reserves:
	•	Sweden: The Kiruna area hosts over 1 million tonnes of rare earth oxides, the largest known deposit in Europe, discovered by state-owned LKAB.
	•	Russia: Holds considerable reserves, though specific tonnage is less defined; import dependence for certain REEs is 80-90%, highlighting extraction challenges.
	•	Regional Potential: The Arctic’s exact REE reserves are hard to quantify due to exploration difficulties, but its resource wealth is significant, alongside 13% of the world’s undiscovered oil and 30% of its natural gas.
	•	Demand Growth:The International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasts that REE demand will triple by 2040, fueled by low-carbon technologies like wind, solar, and electric vehicles.
	•	Investment Example:Australia’s Lynas Rare Earths is investing USD 1.2 billion to expand its Mount Weld mine and processing capabilities, illustrating the scale of capital needed—and potential returns—in the REE sector. Arctic projects could see similar investments.
	•	Economic and Strategic Impact:Developing Arctic REEs could transform the region’s economy, reduce reliance on China (which supplies 60% of global REEs), and support sustainable development goals by enabling carbon-reducing technologies. However, careful environmental management is essential to mitigate mining’s ecological footprint.

This data underscores the Arctic’s growing role in the REE market, blending vast resource potential with significant economic promise. For further research, explore sources like the IEA, LKAB announcements, and market analyses from 2024-2032 projections.

### Survey Note: Comprehensive Analysis of the International Arctic Forum 2025 and Related Discussions

This note provides a detailed examination of Kirill Dmitriev’s role, the International Arctic Forum 2025 held in Murmansk, Russia, and the potential collaborations and participating countries, based on available information as of March 29, 2025. The analysis integrates insights from various sources to offer a thorough understanding, particularly focusing on economic cooperation between Russia and the USA and discussions involving Elon Musk.

#### Background on Kirill Dmitriev and Elon Musk
Kirill Dmitriev, CEO of the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) and appointed as President Vladimir Putin’s special envoy for international economic and investment cooperation, has been actively involved in discussions aimed at fostering ties with the United States. At the International Arctic Forum 2025, Dmitriev highlighted potential collaborations with Elon Musk, the founder of SpaceX, particularly in space exploration. He stated that Russia could offer a small-sized nuclear power plant for Musk’s Mars mission, emphasizing Russia’s nuclear technology as a valuable contribution ([Putin's chief negotiator seeks meeting with Musk to discuss ''humanity's future'' | Ukrai nska Pravda](https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2025/03/18/7503476/)). This was mentioned during the forum, suggesting a linkage between Arctic discussions and broader technological cooperation, possibly extending to economic partnerships.

Dmitriev’s comments, made on March 27, 2025, at the forum, included praising Musk as a “great visionary” and expressing expectations for near-future talks, indicating a strategic interest in aligning Russian capabilities with Musk’s space endeavors ([Russian negotiator says he expects talks with Musk on space, tech](https://kyivindependent.com/russia-expects-talks-with-musk/)). This collaboration, while primarily space-focused, was discussed within the context of the forum, potentially as part of Russia’s broader economic outreach to the USA.

#### International Arctic Forum 2025: Context and Scope
The 6th International Arctic Forum, themed “To Live in the North,” took place on March 26–27, 2025, in Murmansk, organized by the Roscongress Foundation with support from the Russian government ([THE INTERNATIONAL ARCTIC FORUM 2025 | International Arctic Forum «Arctic: Territory of Dialogue»](https://forumarctica.ru/en/)). The forum serves as a key platform for discussing socioeconomic development, regional security, and cooperation in the Arctic, focusing on energy, infrastructure, and environmental projects. President Putin’s speech emphasized Russia’s role as the largest Arctic power and its commitment to equitable cooperation, including with Western partners, though specific mentions of the USA were general ([The Arctic: Territory of Dialogue international forum • President of Russia](http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/76554)).

The forum’s international nature suggests participation from various stakeholders, but a definitive list of countries or delegates is not publicly available from the sources reviewed. However, given its alignment with Arctic Council activities, it likely included representatives from the eight Arctic states: Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden, and the USA ([The Arctic Council | Arctic Council](https://arctic-council.org/)). Additionally, non-Arctic nations with growing Arctic interests, such as China, may have been represented, as global interest in the region continues to rise ([Russia’s Arctic Forum 2025 Underlined Moscow’s Strategy in the Region - SpecialEurasia](https://www.specialeurasia.com/2025/03/29/russias-arctic-forum-2025/)).

#### Economic Cooperation Negotiations Between Russia and USA
Research suggests that economic cooperation negotiations between Russia and the USA at the forum focused on Arctic-related opportunities, particularly natural resources exploration and trade routes. Reports from February 2025 indicate that U.S. and Russian officials have identified the Arctic as a potential area for collaboration, part of President Donald Trump’s broader detente efforts with Moscow ([US, Russia Mull Cooperation on Arctic Trade Routes, Exploration - Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-26/us-russia-mull-cooperation-on-arctic-trade-routes-exploration)). These discussions, described as private and early-stage, include energy exploration, aligning with the forum’s themes. However, specific outcomes or agreements from the forum are not detailed in public sources, suggesting ongoing, behind-the-scenes negotiations.

Dmitriev’s role as an envoy further supports the likelihood of such discussions, given his involvement in U.S.-Russia talks in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, in February 2025, as part of broader economic cooperation efforts ([Putin envoy expects Russia to hold talks with Elon Musk on plans for Mars flights | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/space/putin-envoy-says-he-expects-russia-hold-talks-with-elon-musk-plans-mars-flights-2025-03-18/)). This context suggests that the forum may have served as a platform to continue or highlight these negotiations, though direct evidence of forum-specific agreements is limited.

#### Possible Collaborations and Participating Countries
The forum’s agenda, divided into thematic pillars such as “The Arctic and the Northern Sea Route: Competing on the Global Stage” and “International Cooperation and the Environment,” indicates a wide range of potential collaborations ([The International Arctic Forum 2025 has started in Murmansk](https://forumarctica.ru/en/news/v-murmanske-startoval-mezhdunarodnyj-arkticheskij-forum-2025/)). These include:

- **Economic Partnerships:** Resource extraction and trade route development, particularly along the Northern Sea Route, with potential U.S.-Russia cooperation in energy exploration.
- **Scientific Research:** Collaborative studies on Arctic climate, biodiversity, and sustainable development, likely involving Arctic states and international research bodies.
- **Environmental Protection:** Initiatives for ecosystem conservation, possibly involving multilateral agreements with countries like Norway and Canada.
- **Infrastructure Development:** Projects to improve transport networks, potentially attracting investment from nations like China and Japan.
- **Cultural and Educational Exchanges:** Programs to support indigenous communities, with participation from organizations like the Inuit Circumpolar Council.

A notable, unexpected detail is Dmitriev’s mention of space technology collaboration with Musk, specifically offering nuclear power for Mars missions, which, while not directly Arctic-focused, was discussed at the forum, highlighting Russia’s broader technological ambitions ([Russia offers Elon Musk a nuclear plant for Mars mission](https://kyivindependent.com/russia-may-offer-small-nuclear-plant-for-musks-mars-mission-official-says/)). This suggests a linkage between Arctic and space strategies, possibly as a demonstration of Russia’s capabilities in extreme environments.

The participating countries, while not explicitly listed, are inferred to include the Arctic Council members due to the forum’s international scope and focus. These are:

| **Country**       | **Role**                          |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Canada            | Arctic state, potential delegate  |
| Denmark           | Arctic state, potential delegate  |
| Finland           | Arctic state, potential delegate  |
| Iceland           | Arctic state, potential delegate  |
| Norway            | Arctic state, potential delegate  |
| Russia            | Host, Arctic state                |
| Sweden            | Arctic state, potential delegate  |
| United States     | Arctic state, potential delegate  |

Additionally, non-Arctic states like China, with increasing Arctic involvement, may have participated, given their interest in resources and shipping routes ([Russia’s Arctic Forum 2025 Underlined Moscow’s Strategy in the Region - SpecialEurasia](https://www.specialeurasia.com/2025/03/29/russias-arctic-forum-2025/)). Historical data from previous forums, such as the 2023 event with over 2,000 participants from Russia and foreign countries, supports the likelihood of broad international attendance ([XIII INTERNATIONAL FORUM "ARCTIC: TODAY AND THE FUTURE"](https://www.forumarctic.com/eng/conf2023/)).

#### Conclusion
The International Arctic Forum 2025 in Murmansk facilitated discussions on economic cooperation between Russia and the USA, with Kirill Dmitriev playing a pivotal role in highlighting potential space collaborations with Elon Musk. While specific agreements remain private, the forum likely involved delegates from Arctic states and possibly non-Arctic nations, focusing on a range of collaborations from energy to scientific research. The inclusion of space technology discussions adds an unexpected layer, reflecting Russia’s strategic outreach in both Arctic and global contexts.
